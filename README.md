# SeniorProject
This repository has been created to track the progress of my senior project for the University of Southern Mississippi Bachelor's
of Science in Computer Engineering Technology. In this repository will be not only the code for the project itself, but also
CAD files for anything from schematics to dimensions of any vehicle/platform chosen in this project.
